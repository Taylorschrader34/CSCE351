Instructions:
		HOW TO RUN: In the folder "prob1", run the "make" command and follow that with running "./a.out" and the program will
				run through completion.
		WHAT TO LOOK FOR: Here you should look for it printing out each time the stylist is working on a customer, each time the
					next customer enters the store, as well as whether or not they sit down or if the shop is full
					and they go shopping instead. Then again when the Stylist finishes with a cusomer they will move
					onto the next one if available and then when the next customer comes into the shop they will be 
					seated and the following customer will check if a seat is available and so on. Eventually he will
					finish with all the customers and the program will end with saying that he has served all 120 
					cutomers. With how the DELAY is used there is an equal delay to all functions that use it and so 
					most things will happen around the same time, aka no difference in the time it takes him to cut
					a persons hair and how long they will wait and go shopping so things seem to happen instantly which
					can be fixed by changing the DELAY to a specific delay per each action being performed.
