Instructions:
		HOW TO RUN: In the folder "prob2", run the "make" command and follow that with running "./a.out" and the program will
				run through completion.
		WHAT TO LOOK FOR: Here you should look for it printing out each time the stylist have completed a haircut, shown with the
					"Total haircuts given" line increasing by 1 each time that the stylist completes a haircut. As well we
					update the printout each time that the customer checks whether or not the shop is full or not,
					hence why in my case the "How many times the Salon has been full" output is so high. As well we also update each time that
					the shop is empty with the "How many times the Salon has been empty" output. Finally you can see which seats are taken up
					using the |x|x|x|x|x|x|x output, which shows that a seat is taken with a 1 and a seat is empty with 
					a 0.
